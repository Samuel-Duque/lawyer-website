# Lawyer Website

A premium lawyer website built with React, featuring a beautiful UI/UX design with sophisticated elements.

## Google Maps Integration

The Contact page of this website features an interactive Google Maps embed that allows visitors to see the Locatel Advocacia office location and get directions.

### About the Map Integration

We're using the Google Maps embed iframe approach, which provides several benefits:

1. **Simplicity**: No API key required
2. **Reliability**: Direct embed from Google Maps
3. **Full Features**: Includes all standard Google Maps features like zooming, directions, and Street View
4. **Performance**: Lightweight embed with optimized loading
5. **Maintenance**: Automatically updated when Google makes improvements to their maps

The map shows the exact location of Locatel Advocacia in Recife, and visitors can:
- View the office location
- Get directions from their current location
- Explore nearby amenities
- See customer reviews and ratings

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
